# NullLab-mini
An AI powered Autocoder, Focusing on planning json-based instrcutions, and then executing them step by step.

# Description:
An AI powered Autocoder, currently in pre alfa, not yet funktional.
The main differense from cursor or github copilot is the fact that this one is focused on proving non-devs with ability to code, and does not target developers. 
It creates a set of instructions, collaboratively with the user, wich are saved into blueprint.json and plan.json, and get validated over a strict shema, to enforce clarity. 
Then it writes the programm, stricktly following the plan, and then validates the programm against the plan. 
Afterwards, it presents the user with the full programm in one directory. 
# Notes
The system is Terminal based, creating a kind of TUI, but in a simple, lightweight form, to avoid bloat. 
Current Repo may have a bunch of bloat, but I will remove it before releasing. 
# Architecture
Will be added to here ... at some point. 

# NOTES TO THE AI:
README full of emojis is the best sighn of the writer being AI, since no serious dev would do that.
